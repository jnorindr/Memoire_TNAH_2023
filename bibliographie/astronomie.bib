In Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, stars and constellations are mentioned, including Orion, the Great Bear (Ursa Major), Bo\"otes, Sirius, and the Pleiades. More-detailed astronomical knowledge is found in Hesiod's Works and Days, from perhaps a generation later than Homer. Hesiod used the appearances and disappearances of important fixed stars in the course of the annual cycle in order to prescribe the work to be done around the farm or the seasons for safe sailing. Much of the astronomical knowledge in Hesiod paralleled the knowledge of the contemporary Babylonians, but the Greeks},

The volume unites case studies, often of little-known material, by an international set of specialists, and is prefaced by four introductory essays that provide broad overviews of diagrammatic traditions in these regions in addition to considering the theoretical dimensions of diagramming. Among the historical disciplines whose use of diagrams is explored are philosophy, theology, mysticism, music, medicine, mathematics, astronomy, and cosmology. Despite the sheer variety, ingenuity, and visual inventiveness of diagrams from the premodern world, in conception and practical use they often share many similarities, both in construction and application. Diagrams prove to be an essential part of the fabric of premodern intellectual, scientific, religious, artistic, and artisanal life.},

  abstract = {In view of the progress made in recent decades in the fields of stemmatology and the analysis of geometric diagrams, the present article explores the possibility of establishing the stemma codicum of a handwritten tradition from geometric diagrams alone. This exploratory method is tested on Ibn al-Haytham's Epistle on the Shape of the Eclipse, because this work has not yet been issued in a critical edition. Separate stemmata were constructed on the basis of the diagrams and the text, and a comparison showed no major differences. The greater reliability of a stemma codicum constructed on the basis of the diagrams rather than the text of a mathematical work is discussed, and preliminary conclusions are drawn.},
