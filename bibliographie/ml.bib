  abstract = {Substantial research has explored methods to optimize convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for tasks such as image classification and object detection, but research into the image quality drivers of computer vision performance has been limited. Additionally, there are indications that image degradations such as blur and noise affect human visual interpretation and machine interpretation differently. The general image quality equation (GIQE) predicts overhead image quality for human analysis using the National Image Interpretability Rating Scale, but no such model exists to predict image quality for interpretation by CNNs. Here, we assess the relationship between image quality variables and CNN performance. Specifically, we examine the impacts of resolution, blur, and noise on CNN performance for models trained with in-distribution and out-of-distribution distortions. Using two datasets, we observe that while generalization remains a significant challenge for CNNs faced with out-of-distribution image distortions, CNN performance against low visual quality images remains strong with appropriate training, indicating the potential to expand the design trade space for sensors providing data to computer vision systems. Additionally, we find that CNN performance predictions using the functional form of the GIQE can predict CNN performance as a function of image degradation, but we observe that the legacy form of the GIQE (from GIQE versions 3 and 4) does a better job of modeling the impact of blur/relative edge response in our experiments.},

  abstract = {Aesthetics has been the subject of long-standing debates by philosophers and psychologists alike. In psychology, it is generally agreed that aesthetic experience results from an interaction between perception, cognition, and emotion. By experimental means, this triad has been studied in the field of experimental aesthetics, which aims to gain a better understanding of how aesthetic experience relates to fundamental principles of human visual perception and brain processes. Recently, researchers in computer vision have also gained interest in the topic, giving rise to the field of computational aesthetics. With computing hardware and methodology developing at a high pace, the modeling of perceptually relevant aspect of aesthetic stimuli has a huge potential. In this review, we present an overview of recent developments in computational aesthetics and how they relate to experimental studies. In the first part, we cover topics such as the prediction of ratings, style and artist identification as well as computational methods in art history, such as the detection of influences among artists or forgeries. We also describe currently used computational algorithms, such as classifiers and deep neural networks. In the second part, we summarize results from the field of experimental aesthetics and cover several isolated image properties that are believed to have a effect on the aesthetic appeal of visual stimuli. Their relation to each other and to findings from computational aesthetics are discussed. Moreover, we compare the strategies in the two fields of research and suggest that both fields would greatly profit from a joined research effort. We hope to encourage researchers from both disciplines to work more closely together in order to understand visual aesthetics from an integrated point of view.},

However, historical research is yet to reap the benefits of such advances. This is generally due to the low number of large, coherent, and annotated datasets of historical documents, as well as the overwhelming focus on Optical Character Recognition to support the analysis of historical documents. In this paper, we highlight the importance of visual elements, in particular illustrations in historical documents, and offer a public multi-class historical visual element dataset based on the Sphaera corpus. Additionally, we train an image extraction model based on YOLO architecture and publish it through a publicly available web-service to detect and extract multi-class images from historical documents in an effort to bridge the gap between traditional and computational approaches in historical studies.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a computational approach to edge detection. The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge.},

We show that most segmenters focus on pixel classification and that polygonization of this output has not been used as a target for the latest competition on historical document (ICDAR 2017 and onwards), despite being the focus in the early 2010s. We propose to shift, for efficiency, the task from a pixel classification-based polygonization to an object detection using isothetic rectangles. We compare the output of Kraken and YOLOv5 in terms of segmentation and show that the later severely outperforms the first on small datasets (1110 samples and below). We release two datasets for training and evaluation on historical documents as well as a new package, YALTAi, which injects YOLOv5 in the segmentation pipeline of Kraken 4.1.},

Specifically two classifiers are built, and two different parameterizations have been applied for the QCD. For testing QArt-Learn approach, the Painting-91 dataset has been used, from which the paintings corresponding to Vel\'azquez, Vermeer, Monet, Renoir, van Gogh and Gauguin were extracted, resulting in a set of 252 paintings. The results obtained have shown categorization accuracies higher than 65\%, which are comparable to accuracies obtained in the literature. However, QArt-Learn uses qualitative color names which can describe style color palettes linguistically, so that they can be better understood by non-experts in art since QCDs are aligned with human perception.},

Although many studies have aimed to detect and describe line segments, a comprehensive review is lacking, obstructing their progress. This study fills the gap by comprehensively reviewing related studies on detecting and describing two-dimensional image line segments to provide researchers with an overall picture and deep understanding. Based on their mechanisms, two taxonomies for line segment detection and description are presented to introduce, analyze, and summarize these studies, facilitating researchers to learn about them quickly and extensively. The key issues, core ideas, advantages and disadvantages of existing methods, and their potential applications for each category are analyzed and summarized, including previously unknown findings. The challenges in existing methods and corresponding insights for potentially solving them are also provided to inspire researchers. In addition, some state-of-the-art line segment detection and description algorithms are evaluated without bias, and the evaluation code will be publicly available. The theoretical analysis, coupled with the experimental results, can guide researchers in selecting the best method for their intended vision applications. Finally, this study provides insights for potentially interesting future research directions to attract more attention from researchers to this field.},

  abstract = {We present an unsupervised learning framework for decomposing images into layers of automatically discovered object models. Contrary to recent approaches that model image layers with autoencoder networks, we represent them as explicit transformations of a small set of prototypical images. Our model has three main components: (i) a set of object prototypes in the form of learnable images with a transparency channel, which we refer to as sprites; (ii) differentiable parametric functions predicting occlusions and transformation parameters necessary to instantiate the sprites in a given image; (iii) a layered image formation model with occlusion for compositing these instances into complete images including background. By jointly learning the sprites and occlusion/transformation predictors to reconstruct images, our approach not only yields accurate layered image decompositions, but also identifies object categories and instance parameters. We first validate our approach by providing results on par with the state of the art on standard multi-object synthetic benchmarks (Tetrominoes, Multi-dSprites, CLEVR6). We then demonstrate the applicability of our model to real images in tasks that include clustering (SVHN, GTSRB), cosegmentation (Weizmann Horse) and object discovery from unfiltered social network images. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first layered image decomposition algorithm that learns an explicit and shared concept of object type, and is robust enough to be applied to real images.},

  abstract = {Automated computer vision methods and tools offer new ways of analysing audio-visual material in the realm of the Digital Humanities (DH). While there are some promising results where these tools can be applied, there are basic challenges, such as algorithmic bias and the lack of sufficient transparency, one needs to carefully use these tools in a productive and responsible way. When it comes to the socio-technical understanding of computer vision tools and methods, a major unit of sociological analysis, attentiveness, and access for configuration (for both computer vision scientists and DH scholars) is what computer science calls ``ground truth''. What is specified in the ground truth is the template or rule to follow, e.g. what an object looks like. This article aims at providing scholars in the DH with knowledge about how automated tools for image analysis work and how they are constructed. Based on these insights, the paper introduces an approach called ``active learning'' that can help to configure these tools in ways that fit the specific requirements and research questions of the DH in a more adaptive and user-centered way. We argue that both objectives need to be addressed, as this is, by all means, necessary for a successful implementation of computer vision tools in the DH and related fields.},

  abstract = {Considering the huge amount of art pieces that exist, there is valuable information to be discovered. Examining a painting, an expert can determine its style, genre, and the time period that the painting belongs. One important task for art historians is to find influences and connections between artists. Is influence a task that a computer can measure? The contribution of this paper is in exploring the problem of computer-automated suggestion of influences between artists, a problem that was not addressed before in a general setting. We first present a comparative study of different classification methodologies for the task of fine-art style classification. A two-level comparative study is performed for this classification problem. The first level reviews the performance of discriminative vs. generative models, while the second level touches the features aspect of the paintings and compares semantic-level features vs. low-level and intermediate-level features present in the painting. Then, we investigate the question "Who influenced this artist?" by looking at his masterpieces and comparing them to others. We pose this interesting question as a knowledge discovery problem. For this purpose, we investigated several painting-similarity and artist-similarity measures. As a result, we provide a visualization of artists (Map of Artists) based on the similarity between their works},

  abstract = {Historical watermark recognition is a highly practical, yet unsolved challenge for archivists and historians. With a large number of well-defined classes, cluttered and noisy samples, different types of representations, both subtle differences between classes and high intra-class variation, historical watermarks are also challenging for pattern recognition. In this paper, overcoming the difficulty of data collection, we present a large public dataset with more than 6k new photographs, allowing for the first time to tackle at scale the scenarios of practical interest for scholars: one-shot instance recognition and cross-domain one-shot instance recognition amongst more than 16k fine-grained classes. We demonstrate that this new dataset is large enough to train modern deep learning approaches, and show that standard methods can be improved considerably by using mid-level deep features. More precisely, we design both a matching score and a feature fine-tuning strategy based on filtering local matches using spatial consistency. This consistency-based approach provides important performance boost compared to strong baselines. Our model achieves 55\% top-1 accuracy on our very challenging 16,753-class one-shot cross-domain recognition task, each class described by a single drawing from the classic Briquet catalog. In addition to watermark classification, we show our approach provides promising results on fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval.},
